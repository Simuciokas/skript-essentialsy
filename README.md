## Contribution guide

If you want to contribute but you don't know what to do? Go check out the todo list in the wiki!
This also means that if you want a feature but for example can't code, just add it to the todo!

Before opening a pull request, please test your code to see if it works. Then make sure to write a nice message detailing what you want done and how it'll improve the project. Pull requests that do not follow this will be ignored.

Make sure to write a good commit message explaining what you just added or fixed so the other contributors does't have to look through the code just to get an idea of what you did.
