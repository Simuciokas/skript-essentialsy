## Contribution guide

If you want to contribute but you don't know what to do? Go check out the projects page, find a thing you want to work on and move it to the In Progress column and start working!
This also means that if you want a feature but for example can't code, just add it to the ToDO column!

Before opening a pull request, please test your code to see if it works. Then make sure to write a nice message detailing what you want done and how it'll improve the project. Pull requests that do not follow this will be ignored.

Make sure to write good commit messages explaining what you just added or fixed so the other contributors does't have to look through the code just to get an idea of what you did.

Only pull requests to develop will be merged as master is reserved for hotfixes and releases

When you finish your work with a feature in the ToDo column, please move it to the Done column.

Always put your name in front of the name of a feature branch so for example
```
2legal2_updatechecker
```
This is so one can easily see who's the lead dev of a feature and who to contact for collab on that feature.
