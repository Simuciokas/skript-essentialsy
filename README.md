# Skript-EssentialsY
Skript-EssentialsY is a lightweight addon written in skript that adds and replaces some functionality in EssentialsX

There is currently no wiki but there will be soon. For now i think the plugins help commands provide adequate help.


How to install:

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/2legal2/skript-essentialsy.git
```

Run builder.sh via a linux terminal or git terminal
```
./builder.sh
```

Grab the essentialsy.sk file it generated, thats your skript!
